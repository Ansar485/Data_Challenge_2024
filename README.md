## Abstract
This project is rooted in the [government resolution](https://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/U2400000611) on the National Development Plan of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2029. The primary objective was to analyze the economic sectors most influential in achieving the plan's target of doubling GDP by 2029.

Key steps included data consolidation, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling using SARIMA, and causal inference using ElasticNet. The analysis focused on identifying key sectors that drive GDP growth and their expected impacts.
